#| Design the function ball-image, which consumes representation of a ball

#| Design the function ball-change, which consumes a ball and a key-event which 
represents the user hitting a key on the keyboard. If the key event represents 
the user hitting the up-arrow key, then ball-change produces a new ball which 
is just like the input ball, except that the new ball is moving upward; similarly 
for key events representing the left-, right- and down-arrow keys: they cause 
the resulting ball to be one that is moving left, right, or down, respectively. 
Passing any other keystroke to ball-change causes the ball to be unchanged. 
Reading about key-events in the HelpDesk is a good place to start. |#
